# Make a collection of randomly generated trees

A list of random trees can be generated using [`random_trees`](../api/tree/random_trees.md#piqtree2.random_trees).
Multiple tree generation modes are supported with the [`TreeGenMode`](../api/tree/random_trees.md#piqtree2.TreeGenMode) including
balanced, birth-death, caterpillar, star, uniform, and Yule-Harding trees.
