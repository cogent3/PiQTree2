# Quickstart

Want to jump right in to using `piqtree2`? This is the place to be! Here, you can find examples to:

- Construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.
- Fit branch lengths to a tree topology from an alignment.
- Use different kinds of substitution models.
- Find the model of best fit with ModelFinder.
- Calculate pairwise Jukes-Cantor distances.
- Construct a rapid neighbour-joining tree from a distance matrix.
- Make a collection of randomly generated trees.
- Calculate pairwise Robinson-Foulds distances between trees.
