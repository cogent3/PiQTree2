# Contributing to `piqtree`

We welcome all contributors who would like to work on the `piqtree` project.

## Overview

Contributions can be made through a GitHub pull request to the main repository.
We recommend working off a new branch when contributing new features.

After submitting a pull request, it will be reviewed by a member of the core dev team.
It's rare for a contribution to be accepted without some edits.
This is a constructive process and we hope you will find our remarks useful.

Thanks for participating!

## Code formatting

We use `ruff` to format the project's code. The formatter can be run in the terminal in the project's base directory:

```bash
ruff format
```

## Docstrings

All public-facing functions must be documented and we strongly encourage docstrings for internal functions,
particularly those with wide usage. We follow the [NumPy docstring style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
for all docstrings.
